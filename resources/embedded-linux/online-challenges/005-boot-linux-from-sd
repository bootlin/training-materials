Boot Linux from SD
------------------

We are going to load the kernel and DTB from the FAT
filesystem in the first partition of the emulated SD card.

To make this happen, we have to set U-Boot's "bootcmd"
environment variable to do this.

- The first thing we need is to recompile U-Boot with
  the ability to store its environment in a file in a FAT
  partition (our emulated machine doesn't have flash).

  So, go back to U-Boot's configuration and:
  - unset "Environment in flash memory" (CONFIG_ENV_IS_IN_FLASH)
  - set "Environment is in a FAT filesystem" (CONFIG_ENV_IS_IN_FAT)
  - set "Name of the block device for the environment" (CONFIG_ENV_FAT_INTERFACE) to "mmc"
  - set "Device and partition for where to store the environemt in FAT" (CONFIG_ENV_FAT_DEVICE_AND_PART) to "0:1"
    The above two settings correspond to the arguments of the "fatload" command
    (see the block filesystems lab)
  - Also add support for the "editenv" command (CONFIG_CMD_EDITENV)
    that is not present in the default configuration for our board
    Unfortunately, this command is currently broken.

- Recompile U-Boot

- Start QEMU again, but this time with the emulated SD card:
  qemu-system-arm -M vexpress-a9 -m 128M -nographic -kernel u-boot -sd sd.img

- Then make sure that you can set and store an environment variable:
  setenv foo bar
  saveenv

- Type "reset" and check that "foo" is still set:
  printenv foo

- Now, run "bdinfo" and fine that RAM starts at 0x60000000.
  We will load the kernel image from the SD's FAT partition to
  address 0x61000000, and the DTB at address 0x62000000

  Modify the "bootcmd" environment variable to do this,
  and then boot the kernel from such addresses in RAM.

  Also set the "bootargs" variable to use "ttyAMA0" as console.
  We will configure the root device in the next lab.

- Run "saveenv" then "reset" and then make sure that the
  the board boots the Linux kernel as far as previously.

It's now time to compile a root filesystem for Linux
to use!
