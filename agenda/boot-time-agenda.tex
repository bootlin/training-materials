      in a virtual machine is not supported}, because of issues
    connecting to real hardware.
    \item We need Ubuntu Desktop 20.04 (Xubuntu and other
    variants are fine). We don't support other
    distributions, because we can't test all possible package versions.
    \item {\bf Connection to the Internet} (direct or through the
    company proxy).
    \item {\bf PC computers with valuable data must be backed up}
    before being used in our sessions.  Some people have already made
    mistakes during our sessions and damaged work data.

{Hardware}
{
  The hardware platform used for the practical labs of this training
  session is the {\bf BeagleBone Black} board, which features:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item An ARM AM335x processor from Texas Instruments (Cortex-A8
    based), 3D acceleration, etc.
  \item 512 MB of RAM
  \item 2 GB of on-board eMMC storage
        \newline(4 GB in Rev C)
  \item USB host and device
  \item HDMI output
  \item 2 x 46 pins headers, to access UARTs, SPI buses, I2C buses
    and more.
