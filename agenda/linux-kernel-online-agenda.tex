\section{Labs}

The practical labs of this training session use the following
hardware peripherals to illustrate the development of Linux device
drivers:

\begin{itemize}
\item A Wii Nunchuk, which is connected over the I2C bus to the
  BeagleBone Black board. Its driver will use the Linux {\em input}
  subsystem.
\item An additional UART, which is memory-mapped, and will use the
  Linux {\em misc} subsystem.
\end{itemize}

While our explanations will be focused on specifically the Linux
subsystems needed to implement these drivers, they will always be
generic enough to convey the general design philosophy of the Linux
kernel. The information learnt will therefore apply beyond just
I2C, input or memory-mapped devices.
