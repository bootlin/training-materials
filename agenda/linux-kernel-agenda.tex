\section{Labs}

The practical labs of this training session use the following hardware
peripherals to illustrate the development of Linux device drivers:

\begin{itemize}
\item A Wii Nunchuk, which is connected over the I2C bus to the BeagleBone
  Black board. Its driver will use the Linux {\em input} subsystem.
\item An additional UART, which is memory-mapped, and will use the Linux 
  {\em misc} subsystem.
\end{itemize}

While our explanations will be focused on specifically the Linux subsystems
needed to implement these drivers, they will always be generic enough to convey
the general design philosophy of the Linux kernel. The information learnt will
therefore apply beyond just I2C, input or memory-mapped devices.
