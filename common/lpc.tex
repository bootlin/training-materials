\item Linux Plumbers
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \url{https://lpc.events/}
  \item About the low-level plumbing of Linux: kernel, audio, power
    management, device management, multimedia, etc.
  \item Not really a conventional conference with formal
    presentations, but rather a place where contributors on each topic
    meet, share their progress and make plans for work ahead.
  \end{itemize}
