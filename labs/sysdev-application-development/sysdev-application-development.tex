\subchapter{Application development}{Objective: Compile and run your
  own ncurses application on the target.}

\section{Setup}

Go to the \code{$HOME/__SESSION_NAME__-labs/appdev} directory.

\section{Compile your own application}

We will re-use the system built during the {\em Buildroot lab} and add
to it our own application.

In the lab directory the file \code{app.c} contains a very simple
{\em ncurses} application. It is a simple game where you need to reach
a target using the arrow keys of your keyboard.  We will compile and
integrate this simple application to our Linux system.

Buildroot has generated toolchain wrappers in
\code{output/host/usr/bin}, which make it easier to use the toolchain,
since these wrappers pass some mandatory flags (especially the
\code{--sysroot} {\em gcc} flag, which tells {\em gcc} where to look
for the headers and libraries).

Let's add this directory to our \code{PATH}:

%\footnotesize
\begin{terminalinput}
export PATH=$HOME/__SESSION_NAME__-labs/buildroot/buildroot-2020.02.X/output/host/usr/bin:$PATH
\end{terminalinput}
%\normalsize

Let's try to compile the application:

\begin{verbatim}
arm-linux-gcc -o app app.c
\end{verbatim}

It complains about undefined references to some symbols. This is
normal, since we didn't tell the compiler to link with the necessary
libraries. So let's use \code{pkg-config} to query the {\em
pkg-config} database about the location of the header files and the
list of libraries needed to build an application against
{\em ncurses}\footnote{Again, \code{output/host/usr/bin} has a special
\code{pkg-config} that automatically knows where to look, so it
already knows the right paths to find \code{.pc} files and their
sysroot.}:

\begin{verbatim}
arm-linux-gcc -o app app.c $(pkg-config --libs --cflags ncurses)
\end{verbatim}

You can see that \code{ncurses} doesn't need anything in particular for the
\code{CFLAGS} but you can have a look at what is needed for
{\em libvorbis} to get a feel of what it can look like:

\begin{verbatim}
pkg-config --libs --cflags vorbis
\end{verbatim}

Our application is now compiled! Copy the generated binary to the NFS
root filesystem (in the \code{root/} directory for example), start
your system, and run your application!

You can also try to run it over ssh if you add ssh support to your
target.
