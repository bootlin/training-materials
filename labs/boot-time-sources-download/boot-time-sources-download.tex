\subchapter{Downloading bootloader, kernel and Buildroot source
code}{Save time and start fetching the source code that you will need
during these labs}

\section{Installing the git package}

We are going to access bootloader, kernel and Buildroot sources through
their \code{git} repositories, which will allow us to track any changes
that we make to the source code of these projects.

Depending on how fast your network connection is (and how many users
share it), fetching such sources is likely to take a significant amount
of time. That's why we're starting such downloads now.

So, let's install the below package:

\begin{verbatim}
sudo apt install git
\end{verbatim}

\section{Cloning the Buildroot source tree}

Go to the \code{$HOME/boot-time-labs/rootfs} directory.

\begin{verbatim}
git clone https://gitlab.com/buildroot.org/buildroot.git
\end{verbatim}

We will select a particular release tag later. Let's move on to the next
source repository.

\section{Cloning the U-Boot source tree}

Create the \code{$HOME/boot-time-labs/bootloader} directory and go
into it.

\begin{verbatim}
git clone https://git.denx.de/u-boot
\end{verbatim}

\section{Cloning the mainline Linux tree}

Go to the \code{$HOME/boot-time-labs/kernel} directory.

\begin{verbatim}
git clone https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux
\end{verbatim}

\section{Accessing stable Linux releases}

Go to the \code{linux} source directory.

Having the Linux kernel development sources is great, but when you are
creating products, you prefer to avoid working with a target that moves
every day.

That's why we need to use the {\em stable} releases of the Linux
kernel.

Fortunately, with \code{git}, you won't have to clone an entire source
tree again. All you need to do is add a reference to a {\em remote}
tree, and fetch only the commits which are specific to that remote tree.

{\small
\begin{verbatim}
git remote add stable https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-stable
git fetch stable
\end{verbatim}
}

We will choose a particular stable version in the next labs.

Now, let's continue the lectures. This will leave time for the commands
that you typed to complete their execution (if needed).
