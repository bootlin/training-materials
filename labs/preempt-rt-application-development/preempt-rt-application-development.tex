\subchapter{Lab4: Optimizing an application for Real-Time}{}

During this lab, you will:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Better understand the page-faulting mechanism
\end{itemize}

\section{Compile and run the program}

Compile the \code{pgflt} program: \code{make pgflt}

Test the various options, and analyze how the Stack and Heap are allocated and
pre-faulted :

\begin{itemize}
	\item \code{./pgflt 0x10}
	\item \code{./pgflt 0x1f}
\end{itemize}

Try modifying the makefile to compile with more aggressive optimization options
such as \code{-O3}. What do you notice ?

Use ftrace to visualise the page-fault occurings:
\begin{bashinput}
	trace-cmd record -e *page_fault* ./crc_test
\end{bashinput}
