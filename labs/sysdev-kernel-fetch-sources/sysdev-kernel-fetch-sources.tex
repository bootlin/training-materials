\subchapter{Fetching Linux kernel sources}{Objective: learn how to fetch
the Linux kernel sources from git, from both the master and stable
branches.}

After this lab, you will be able to:
\begin{itemize}
\item Get the kernel sources from git, using the official Linux source
      tree.
\item Fetch the sources for the stable Linux releases, by declaring
      a remote tree and getting stable branches from it.
\end{itemize}

\section{Setup}

Create the \code{$HOME/__SESSION_NAME__-labs/kernel} directory and go into it.

Since the Linux kernel git repository is huge, our goal here is to start
downloading it right now, before starting the lectures about the Linux
kernel.
