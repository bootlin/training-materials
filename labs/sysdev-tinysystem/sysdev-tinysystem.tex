\subchapter{Tiny embedded system with BusyBox}{Objective: making a tiny yet full featured embedded system}

After this lab, you will:
\begin{itemize}
\item be able to configure and build a Linux kernel that boots on a
  directory on your workstation, shared through the network by NFS.
\item be able to create and configure a minimalistic root filesystem
  from scratch (ex nihilo, out of nothing, entirely hand made...) for
  the Xplained board
\item understand how small and simple an embedded Linux system can be.
\item be able to install BusyBox on this filesystem.
\item be able to create a simple startup script based on /sbin/init.
\item be able to set up a simple web interface for the target.
\item have an idea of how much RAM a Linux kernel smaller than 1 MB needs.
\end{itemize}

\section{Lab implementation}

While (s)he develops a root filesystem for a device, a developer needs
to make frequent changes to the filesystem contents, like modifying
scripts or adding newly compiled programs.

It isn't practical at all to reflash the root filesystem on the target
every time a change is made. Fortunately, it is possible to set up
networking between the development workstation and the target. Then,
workstation files can be accessed by the target through the network,
using NFS.

Unless you test a boot sequence, you no longer need to reboot the
target to test the impact of script or application updates.

\section{Setup}

Go to the \code{$HOME/embedded-linux-labs/tinysystem/} directory.

\section{Kernel configuration}

We will re-use the kernel sources from our previous lab, in
\code{$HOME/embedded-linux-labs/kernel/}.

In the kernel configuration built in the previous lab, verify that you
have all options needed for booting the system using a root filesystem
mounted over NFS, and if necessary, enable them and rebuild your
kernel.

\section{Setting up the NFS server}

Create a \code{nfsroot} directory in the current lab directory. This
\code{nfsroot} directory will be used to store the contents of our new
root filesystem.

Install the NFS server by installing the \code{nfs-kernel-server}
package if you don't have it yet. Once installed, edit the
\code{/etc/exports} file as root to add the following line, assuming that the
IP address of your board will be \code{192.168.0.100}:

\footnotesize
\begin{verbatim}
/home/<user>/embedded-linux-labs/tinysystem/nfsroot 192.168.0.100(rw,no_root_squash,no_subtree_check)
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

Make sure that the path and the options are on the same line.
Also make sure that there is no space between the IP address and the NFS
options, otherwise default options will be used for this IP address,
causing your root filesystem to be read-only.

Then, restart the NFS server:

\begin{verbatim}
sudo service nfs-kernel-server restart
\end{verbatim}

\section{Booting the system}

First, boot the board to the U-Boot prompt. Before booting the kernel,
we need to tell it that the root filesystem should be mounted over
NFS, by setting some kernel parameters.

Use the following U-Boot command to do so, {\bf in just 1 line}

\begin{verbatim}
setenv bootargs console=ttyS0,115200 root=/dev/nfs ip=192.168.0.100:::::eth0
   nfsroot=192.168.0.1:/home/<user>/embedded-linux-labs/tinysystem/nfsroot rw
\end{verbatim}

Of course, you need to adapt the IP addresses to your exact network
setup. Save the environment variables (with \code{saveenv}).

You will later need to make changes to the \code{bootargs} value.
Don't forget you can do this with the \code{editenv} command.

Now, boot your system. The kernel should be able to mount the root
filesystem over NFS:

\begin{verbatim}
VFS: Mounted root (nfs filesystem) on device 0:14.
\end{verbatim}

If the kernel fails to mount the NFS filesystem, look carefully at the
error messages in the console. If this doesn't give any clue, you can
also have a look at the NFS server logs in \code{/var/log/syslog}.

However, at this stage, the kernel should stop because of the below
issue:

\begin{verbatim}
[    7.476715] devtmpfs: error mounting -2
\end{verbatim}

This happens because the kernel is trying to mount the {\em devtmpfs}
filesystem in \code{/dev/} in the root filesystem. To address this,
create a \code{dev} directory under \code{nfsroot} and reboot.

Now, the kernel should complain for the last time, saying that it can't
find an init application:

\footnotesize
\begin{verbatim}
Kernel panic - not syncing: No working init found.  Try passing init= option to kernel.
  See Linux Documentation/init.txt for guidance.
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

Obviously, our root filesystem being mostly empty, there isn't such an
application yet. In the next paragraph, you will add Busybox to your root
filesystem and finally make it usable.

\section{Root filesystem with Busybox}

Download the sources of the latest BusyBox 1.24.x release.

To configure BusyBox, we won't be able to use \code{make xconfig},
which is currently broken for BusyBox in Ubuntu (14.04 and 16.04),
because of Qt library dependencies.

We are going to use \code{make gconfig} this time. Before doing this,
install the required packages:

\begin{verbatim}
sudo apt-get install libglade2-dev
\end{verbatim}

Now, configure BusyBox with the configuration file provided in the
\code{data/} directory (remember that the Busybox configuration file
is \code{.config} in the Busybox sources).

If you don't use the BusyBox configuration file that we provide, at least,
make sure you build BusyBox statically! Compiling Busybox
statically in the first place makes it easy to set up the system,
because there are no dependencies on libraries. Later on, we will set
up shared libraries and recompile Busybox.

Build BusyBox using the toolchain that you used to build the kernel.

Going back to the BusyBox configuration interface
specify the installation directory for BusyBox\footnote{You will find
this setting in \code{Install Options -> BusyBox installation prefix}.}.
It should be the path to your \code{nfsroot} directory.

Now run \code{make install} to install BusyBox in this directory.

Try to boot your new system on the board. You should now reach a
command line prompt, allowing you to execute the commands of your
choice.

\section{Virtual filesystems}

Run the \code{ps} command. You can see that it complains that the
\code{/proc} directory does not exist. The ps command and other
process-related commands use the \code{proc} virtual filesystem to get
their information from the kernel.

From the Linux command line in the target, create the \code{proc},
\code{sys} and \code{etc} directories in your root filesystem.

Now mount the \code{proc} virtual filesystem. Now that \code{/proc} is
available, test again the \code{ps} command.

Note that you can also now halt your target in a clean way with the \code{halt}
command, thanks to \code{proc} being mounted\footnote{\code{halt}
can find the list of mounted filesystems in \code{/proc/mounts}, and
unmount each of them in a clean way before shutting down.}.

\section{System configuration and startup}

The first user space program that gets executed by the kernel is
\code{/sbin/init} and its configuration file is \code{/etc/inittab}.

In the BusyBox sources, read details about \code{/etc/inittab} in the
\code{examples/inittab} file.

Then, create a \code{/etc/inittab} file and a \code{/etc/init.d/rcS}
startup script declared in \code{/etc/inittab}. In this startup
script, mount the \code{/proc} and \code{/sys} filesystems.

Any issue after doing this?

\section{Starting the shell in a proper terminal}

Before the shell prompt, you probably noticed the below warning message:

\begin{verbatim}
/bin/sh: can't access tty; job control turned off
\end{verbatim}

This happens because the shell specified in the \code{/etc/inittab} file
in started by default in \code{/dev/console}:

\begin{verbatim}
::askfirst:/bin/sh
\end{verbatim}

When nothing is specified before the leading \code{::}, \code{/dev/console}
is used. However, while this device is fine for a simple shell, it is
not elaborate enough to support things such as job control
(\code{[Ctrl][c]} and \code{[Ctrl][z]}), allowing to interrupt and
suspend jobs. 

So, to get rid of the warning message, we need \code{init} to run
\code{/bin/sh} in a real terminal device:

\begin{verbatim}
ttyS0::askfirst:/bin/sh
\end{verbatim}

Reboot the system and the message will be gone!

\section{Switching to shared libraries}

Take the \code{hello.c} program supplied in the lab \code{data}
directory. Cross-compile it for ARM, dynamically-linked with the
libraries, and run it on the target.

You will first encounter a very misleading \code{not found} error,
which is not because the \code{hello} executable is not found, but
because something else is not found using the attempt to execute
this executable. What's missing is the \code{ld-uClibc.so.0}
executable, which is the dynamic linker required to execute any
program compiled with shared libraries. Using the \code{find}
command (see examples in your command memento sheet), look for this
file in the toolchain install directory, and copy it to the
\code{lib/} directory on the target.

Then, running the executable again and see that the loader executes
and finds out which shared libraries are missing.

If you still get the same error message, work, just try again a
few seconds later.  Such a delay can be needed because the NFS
client can take a little time (at most 30-60 seconds) before
seeing the changes made on the NFS server.

Similarly, find the missing libraries in the toolchain and copy
them to \code{lib/} on the target.

Once the small test program works, we are going to recompile Busybox
without the static compilation option, so that Busybox takes
advantages of the shared libraries that are now present on the target.

Before doing that, measure the size of the \code{busybox} executable.

Then, build Busybox with shared libraries, and install it again on the
target filesystem. Make sure that the system still boots and see how
much smaller the \code{busybox} executable got.

\section{Implement a web interface for your device}

Replicate \code{data/www/} to the \code{/www} directory in your target
root filesystem.

Now, run the BusyBox http server from the target command line:

\begin{verbatim}
/usr/sbin/httpd -h /www/
\end{verbatim}

It will automatically background itself.

If you use a proxy, configure your host browser so that it doesn't go
through the proxy to connect to the target IP address, or simply
disable proxy usage.  Now, test that your web interface works well by
opening \code{http://192.168.0.100} on the host.

See how the dynamic pages are implemented. Very simple, isn't it?
