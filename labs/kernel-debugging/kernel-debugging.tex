\subchapter{Kernel debugging mechanisms and kernel crash
  analysis}{Objective: Use kernel debugging mechanisms and analyze a
  kernel crash}

In this lab, we will continue to work on the code of our serial driver.

\section{dev\_dbg() and dynamic debugging}

Add a \kfunc{dev_dbg} call in the \code{write()} operation that shows
each character being written (or its hexadecimal representation) and
add a similar \kfunc{dev_dbg} call in your interrupt handler to show
each character being received.

Check what happens with your module. Do you see the debugging messages
that you added? Your kernel probably does not have
\kconfig{CONFIG_DYNAMIC_DEBUG} set and your driver is not compiled with
\code{DEBUG} defined, so you shouldn't see any message.

Now, recompile your kernel with the following options:

\begin{itemize}
\item \kconfig{CONFIG_DYNAMIC_DEBUG}: this will allow you to see
  debugging messages.
\item \kconfig{CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO}: this option will make it
  possible to see source code in disassembled kernel code.
  We will need it in a later part of this lab, but enabling
  it now will allow to avoid recompiling the whole kernel again.
\end{itemize}

Also recompile the kernel module to have it built against the updated kernel
config in order to take in account the new enabled options.

Once this is done, in U-Boot, add \code{loglevel=8} to the kernel
command line to get the debugging messages directly in the console
(otherwise you will only see them in \code{dmesg}).

Now boot your updated kernel.

The dynamic debug feature can be configured using \code{debugfs}, so you'll have
to mount the \code{debugfs} filesystem first. Then, after reading the dynamic
debug documentation in the kernel sources, do the following things:

\begin{itemize}

\item List all available debug messages in the kernel.

\item Enable all debugging messages of your serial module, and check
  that you indeed see these messages.

\item Enable just one single debug message in your serial module, and
  check that you see just this message and not the other debug
  messages of your module.

\end{itemize}

Now, you have a good mechanism to keep many debug messages in your
drivers and be able to selectively enable only some of them.

\section{debugfs}

After using \code{debugfs} for controlling the dynamic debug feature,
let's add a new entry in this filesystem. Modify your driver to
add:

\begin{itemize}

\item A directory called after a unique name per device in the
  \code{debugfs} filesystem.

\item And file called \code{counter} inside this directory of the
  \code{debugfs} filesystem. This file should allow to see the
  contents of the \code{counter} variable of your module.

\end{itemize}

Recompile and reload your driver, and check that in
\code{/sys/kernel/debug/<unique name>/counter} you can see the amount
of characters that have been transmitted by your driver.

\section{Kernel crash analysis}

\subsection{Setup}

Go to the \code{~/__SESSION_NAME__-labs/modules/nfsroot/root/debugging/}
directory.

Compile the \code{drvbroken} in this directory, and load it on your
board. See it crashing in a nice way.

\subsection{Analyzing the crash message}

Analyze the crash message carefully. Knowing that on ARM, the \code{PC}
register contains the location of the instruction being executed, find
in which function does the crash happen, and what the function call
stack is.

Using Elixir or the kernel source code, have a look at the definition of this
function. This, with a careful review of the driver source code should
probably be enough to help you understand and fix the issue.

\subsection{Locating the exact line where the error happens}

Even if you already found out which instruction caused the crash, it's
useful to use information in the crash report.

If you look again, the report tells you at what offset in the function
this happens. Let's disassemble the code for this function to
understand exactly where the issue happened.

That's where we need a kernel compiled with \kconfig{CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO}
as we did at the beginning of this lab. This way, the kernel is
compiled with \code{$(CROSSCOMPILE)gcc -g}, which keeps the source
code inside the binaries.

You could disassemble the whole \code{vmlinux} file and work with
the \code{PC} absolute address, but it is going to take a long time.

Instead, using Elixir, you'll find that the crash happens in an function
defined in assembly, called by a function implemented in C. Find
the \code{.c} source file where the C function is implemented.

In the kernel sources, you can then find
and dissassemble the corresponding \code{.o} file:

\if\defstring{\labboard}{beaglebone}{
\begin{verbatim}
arm-linux-gnueabi-objdump -DS file.o > file.S
\end{verbatim}
}\fi
\if\defstring{\labboard}{beagleplay}{
\begin{verbatim}
aarch64-linux-gnu-objdump -DS file.o > file.S
\end{verbatim}
}\fi

Another way to do this is to use {gdb-multiarch}\footnote{gdb-multiarch is a new package
supporting multiple architectures at once. If you have a cross
toolchain including gdb, you can also run arm-linux-gdb directly.}:

\if\defstring{\labboard}{beaglebone}{
\begin{verbatim}
sudo apt install gdb-multiarch
gdb-multiarch vmlinux
(gdb) set arch arm
(gdb) set gnutarget elf32-littlearm
(gdb) disassemble function_name
\end{verbatim}
}\fi
\if\defstring{\labboard}{beagleplay}{
\begin{verbatim}
sudo apt install gdb-multiarch
gdb-multiarch vmlinux
(gdb) set arch aarch64
(gdb) set gnutarget elf64-littlearm
(gdb) disassemble function_name
\end{verbatim}
}\fi

Then, in the disassembled code, find the start address of the
function, and using an hexadecimal calculator, add the offset that
was provided in the crash output. That's how you can find the
exact assembly instruction where the crash occured, together
with the C code it was compiled from. Looking at the addresses
handled by this code, you can now guess what is wrong in the
data passed to the stack of kernel functions called by the
broken module.

A little understanding of assembly instructions on the architecture
you are working on helps, but seeing the original C code should answer
most questions. Anyway, it is also possible to get an automated
translation of the symbol offsets using
\code{scripts/decode_stacktrace.sh} (in the kernel sources).

Note that the same technique works if the error comes directly from
the code of a module. Just dissassemble the \code{.o} file
the \code{.ko} file was generated from.
