\subchapter{Kernel - Cross-compiling}{Objective: Learn how to
cross-compile a kernel for an ARM target platform.}

After this lab, you will be able to:
\begin{itemize}
\item Set up a cross-compiling environment
\item Cross compile the kernel for the \labboarddescription
\item Use U-Boot to download the kernel
\item Check that the kernel you compiled starts the system
\end{itemize}

\section{Setup}

Go to the \code{$HOME/__SESSION_NAME__-labs/kernel} directory.

\section{Kernel sources}

We will re-use the kernel sources downloaded and patched in the
previous lab.

\section{Cross-compiling environment setup}

To cross-compile Linux, you need to have a cross-compiling
toolchain. We will use the cross-compiling toolchain that we
previously produced, so we just need to make it available in the PATH:

\bashcmd{$ export PATH=$HOME/x-tools/arm-training-linux-uclibcgnueabihf/bin:$PATH}

Also, don't forget to either:

\begin{itemize}
\item Define the value of the \code{ARCH} and \code{CROSS_COMPILE}
  variables in your environment (using \code{export})
\item {\bf Or} specify them on the command line at every invocation of
  \code{make}, i.e: \code{make ARCH=... CROSS_COMPILE=... <target>}
\end{itemize}

\section{Linux kernel configuration}

\ifdefstring{\labboard}{discovery}
{
We could use the \code{multi_v7_defconfig} default configuration to
build a working kernel but to save time and compile less code, we
provide in
\code{$HOME/__SESSION_NAME__-labs/linux-stm32/} a minimal configuration
file, named \code{stm32mp157_defconfig}. Copy it to \code{.config} and
then run either \code{make olddefconfig} or \code{make oldconfig} if
you want to get asked for all the possible choices.
}
{
By running \code{make help}, find the proper Makefile target to
configure the kernel
\ifdefstring{\labboard}{qemu}
{for the ARM Vexpress boards (\code{vexpress_defconfig}).}
{for the Xplained board (hint: the default
configuration is not named after the board, but after the SoC
name). Once found, use this target to configure the kernel with the
ready-made configuration.}
}

Don't hesitate to visualize the new settings by running
\code{make xconfig} afterwards!

In the kernel configuration, as an experiment, change the kernel
compression from Gzip to XZ. This compression algorithm is far more
efficient than Gzip, in terms of compression ratio, at the expense of
a higher decompression time.

\ifdefstring{\labboard}{qemu}
{Also add \kconfig{CONFIG_DEVTMPFS_MOUNT} to your configuration.}
{}

\section{Cross compiling}

At this stage, you need to install the \code{libssl-dev}
package to compile the kernel.

You're now ready to cross-compile your kernel. Simply run:

\bashcmd{$ make}

and wait a while for the kernel to compile. Don't forget to use
\code{make -j<n>} if you have multiple cores on your machine!

Look at the end of the kernel build output to see which file contains
the kernel image. You can also see the Device Tree \code{.dtb} files
which got compiled. Find which \code{.dtb} file corresponds to your
board.

Copy the linux kernel image and DTB files to the TFTP server
home directory.

\section{Load and boot the kernel using U-Boot}

As we are going to boot the Linux kernel from U-Boot,
we need to set the \code{bootargs} environment corresponding
to the Linux kernel command line:

\begin{ubootinput}
=> setenv bootargs console=%\ttyname%
\end{ubootinput}
We will use TFTP to load the kernel image on the board:

\begin{itemize}

\item On your workstation, copy the \code{zImage} and DTB
(\texttt\dtbname) to the directory exposed by the TFTP server.

\item On the target (in the U-Boot prompt), load \code{zImage} from
TFTP into RAM:
\begin{ubootinput}
=> tftp %\zimageboardaddr% zImage
\end{ubootinput}

\item Now, also load the DTB file into RAM:
\begin{ubootinput}
=> tftp %\dtbboardaddr% %\dtbname%
\end{ubootinput}

\item Boot the kernel with its device tree:
\begin{ubootinput}
=> bootz %\zimageboardaddr% - %\dtbboardaddr%
\end{ubootinput}

\end{itemize}

You should see Linux boot and finally panicking. This is expected: we
haven't provided a working root filesystem for our device yet.

You can now automate all this every time the board is booted or
reset. Reset the board, and customize \code{bootcmd}:

\begin{ubootinput}
=> setenv bootcmd 'tftp %\zimageboardaddr\ zImage; tftp \dtbboardaddr\ \dtbname; bootz \zimageboardaddr\ - \dtbboardaddr'%
=> saveenv
\end{ubootinput}

Restart the board to make sure that booting the kernel is now automated.
