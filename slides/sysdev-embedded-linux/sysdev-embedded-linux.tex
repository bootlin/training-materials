\subsection{Leveraging open-source components in an Embedded Linux
  system}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Third party libraries and applications}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item One of the advantages of embedded Linux is the wide range of
    third-party libraries and applications that one can leverage in
    its product
    \begin{itemize}
    \item They are freely available, freely distributable, and thanks
      to their open-source nature, they can be analyzed and modified
      according to the needs of the project
    \end{itemize}
  \item However, efficiently re-using these components is not always
    easy. One must:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Find these components
    \item Choose the most appropriate ones
    \item Cross-compile them
    \item Integrate them in the embedded system and with the other
      applications
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Find existing components}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Look at the list of software packaged by embedded Linux build
    systems
    \begin{itemize}
    \item These are typically chosen for their suitability to embedded
      systems
    \end{itemize}
  \item Look at other embedded Linux products, and see what their
    components are - \url{https://linuxgizmos.com/} is a good source
    of information.
  \item Ask the community or your favorite search engine
  \item This presentation will also feature a list of components for
    common needs
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Choosing components}
  Not all free software components are necessarily good to
  re-use. One must pay attention to:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item {\bf Vitality} of the developer and user communities. This
    vitality ensures long-term maintenance of the component, and
    relatively good support. It can be measured by looking at the
    mailing-list traffic and the version control system activity.
  \item {\bf Quality} of the component. Typically, if a component is
    already available through embedded build systems, and has a
    dynamic user community, it probably means that the quality is
    relatively good.
  \item {\bf License}. The license of the component must match your
    licensing constraints. For example, GPL libraries cannot be used
    in proprietary applications.
  \item {\bf Technical requirements}. Of course, the component must
    match your technical requirements. But don't forget that you can
    improve the existing components if a feature is missing!
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Licenses (1)}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item All software that are under a free software license give four
    freedoms to all users
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Freedom to use
    \item Freedom to study
    \item Freedom to copy
    \item Freedom to modify and distribute modified copies
    \end{itemize}
  \item See \url{https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html} for a
    definition of Free Software
  \item Open Source software, as per the definition of the Open Source
    Initiative, are technically similar to Free Software in terms of
    freedoms
  \item See \url{https://www.opensource.org/docs/osd} for the definition of
    Open Source Software
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Licenses (2)}
  \begin{columns}
    \column{0.8\textwidth}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Free Software licenses fall in two main categories
      \begin{itemize}
      \item The copyleft licenses
      \item The non-copyleft licenses
      \end{itemize}
    \item The concept of {\em copyleft} is to ask for reciprocity in the
      freedoms given to a user.
    \item The result is that when you receive a software under a
      copyleft free software license and distribute modified versions of
      it, you must do so under the same license
      \begin{itemize}
      \item Same freedoms to the new users
      \item It's an incentive to contribute back your changes instead of
        keeping them secret
      \end{itemize}
    \item Non-copyleft licenses have no such requirements, and modified
      versions can be made proprietary, but they still require
      attribution
    \end{itemize}
    \column{0.2\textwidth}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{slides/sysdev-embedded-linux/copyleft.pdf}
  \end{columns}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{GPL}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item {\bf GNU General Public License}
    \hfill \includegraphics[width=6em]{slides/sysdev-embedded-linux/gpl-v3.pdf}
  \item Covers around 55\% of the free software projects
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Including the Linux kernel, Busybox and many applications
    \end{itemize}
  \item Is a copyleft license
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Requires derivative works to be released under the same
      license
    \item Programs linked with a library released under the GPL must
      also be released under the GPL
    \end{itemize}
  \item Some programs covered by version 2 (Linux kernel, Busybox, U-Boot...)
  \item A number of programs are covered by version 3, released in 2007:
	gcc, bash, grub, samba, Qt...
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Major change for the embedded market: the requirement that
      the user must be able to {\bf run} the modified versions on the
      device, if the device is a {\em consumer} device
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{GPL: redistribution}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item No obligation when the software is not distributed
    \begin{itemize}
    \item You can keep your modifications secret until the product
      delivery
    \end{itemize}
  \item It is then authorized to distribute binary versions, if one of
    the following conditions is met:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Convey the binary with a copy of the source on a physical
      medium
    \item Convey the binary with a written offer valid for 3 years
      that indicates how to fetch the source code
    \item Convey the binary with the network address of a location
      where the source code can be found
    \item See section 6. of the GPL license
    \end{itemize}
  \item In all cases, the attribution and the license must be
    preserved
    \begin{itemize}
    \item See sections 4. and 5.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{LGPL}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item {\bf GNU Lesser General Public License}
    \hfill \includegraphics[width=6em]{slides/sysdev-embedded-linux/lgpl-v3.pdf}
  \item Covers around 10\% of the free software projects
  \item A copyleft license
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Modified versions must be released under the same license
    \item But, programs linked against a library under the LGPL do not
      need to be released under the LGPL and can be kept proprietary.
    \item However, the user must keep the ability to update the
      library independently from the program. Dynamic linking is the
      easiest solution. Statically linked executables are only possible
      if the developer provides a way to relink with an update
      (with source code or linkable object files).
    \item If this constraint is too strong for you, use a library
      with a more permissive license if you can (such as the {\em musl}
      C library, with MIT license).
    \end{itemize}
  \item Used instead of the GPL for most of the libraries, including
    the C libraries
  \item Also available in two versions, v2 and v3
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Licensing: examples}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item You make modifications to the Linux kernel (to add drivers or
    adapt to your board), to Busybox, U-Boot or other GPL software
    \begin{itemize}
    \item You must release the modified versions under the same
      license, and be ready to distribute the source code to your
      customers
    \end{itemize}
  \item You make modifications to the C library or any other LGPL
    library
    \begin{itemize}
    \item You must release the modified versions under the same
      license
    \end{itemize}
  \item You create an application that relies on LGPL libraries
    \begin{itemize}
    \item You can keep your application proprietary, but you must link
      dynamically with the LGPL libraries
    \end{itemize}
  \item You make modifications to a non-copyleft licensed software
    \begin{itemize}
    \item You can keep your modifications proprietary, but you must
      still credit the authors
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Non-copyleft licenses}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item A large family of non-copyleft licenses that are relatively
    similar in their requirements
  \item A few examples
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Apache license (around 4\%)
    \item BSD license (around 6\%)
    \item MIT license (around 4\%)
    \item X11 license
    \item Artistic license (around 9 \%)
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Is this free software?}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Most of the free software projects are covered by ~10
    well-known licenses, so it is fairly easy for the majority of
    projects to get a good understanding of the license
  \item Otherwise, read the license text
  \item Check Free Software Foundation's opinion\\
    \url{https://www.fsf.org/licensing/licenses/}
  \item Check Open Source Initiative's opinion\\
    \url{https://www.opensource.org/licenses}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Respect free software licenses}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Free Software is not public domain software, the distributors
    have obligations due to the licenses
    \begin{itemize}
    \item {\bf Before} using a free software component, make sure the
      license matches your project constraints
    \item Make sure to keep a complete list of the free software
      packages you use, the original version numbers you used, and to
      keep your modifications and adaptations well-separated from
      the original version.
    \item Buildroot and Yocto Project can generate this list for you!
    \item Conform to the license requirements before shipping the
      product to the customers.
    \end{itemize}
  \item Free Software licenses have been enforced successfully in
    courts. Organizations which can help:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Software Freedom Law Center, \url{https://www.softwarefreedom.org/}
    \item Software Freedom Conservancy, \url{https://sfconservancy.org/}
    \end{itemize}
  \item Ask your legal department!
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Keeping changes separate (1)}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item When integrating existing open-source components in your
    project, it is sometimes needed to make modifications to them
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Better integration, reduced footprint, bug fixes, new
      features, etc.
    \end{itemize}
  \item Instead of mixing these changes, it is much better to keep
    them separate from the original component version
    \begin{itemize}
    \item If the component needs to be upgraded, easier to know what
      modifications were made to the component
    \item If support from the community is requested, important to
      know how different the component we're using is from the
      upstream version
    \item Makes contributing the changes back to the community
      possible
    \end{itemize}
  \item It is even better to keep the various changes made on a given
    component separate
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Easier to review and to update to newer versions
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Keeping changes separate (2)}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item The simplest solution is to use Quilt
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Quilt is a tool that allows to maintain a stack of patches
      over source code
    \item Makes it easy to add, remove modifications from a patch, to
      add and remove patches from stack and to update them
    \item The stack of patches can be integrated into your version
      control system
    \item \url{https://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/quilt/}
    \end{itemize}
  \item Another solution is to use a version control system
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Import the original component version into your version
      control system
    \item Maintain your changes in a separate branch
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

    connected to the device. No need to support multiple operating
    systems!
  \item Just need to develop static or dynamic HTML pages (possibly
    with powerful client-side JavaScript).\\
    Easy way of providing access to device information and parameters.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Qt is more than just a graphical toolkit, it also offers a
    complete development framework: data structures, threads, network,
    databases, XML, etc.
  \item See our presentation {\em Qt for non graphical applications}
    presentation at ELCE 2011 (Thomas Petazzoni):
    \url{https://j.mp/W4PK85}
  \item Qt Embedded has an integrated windowing system, allowing
    several applications to share the same screen
  \item Very well documented
  \item License: mix of LGPLv3 and GPLv3 (and LGPLv2 and GPLv2 for some
        parts), making it difficult to implement non GPL applications.
        According to customers, the commercial license is very expensive
        (about 5 USD per unit for volumes in thousands of devices).

      \item It involves the download, extraction, configuration,
        compilation and installation of all components, and possibly
        fixing issues and adapting configuration files
      \end{itemize}
    \item Several solutions
      \begin{itemize}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{System building: manually}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Manually building a target system involves downloading,
    configuring, compiling and installing all the components of the
    system.
  \item All the libraries and dependencies must be configured,
    compiled and installed in the right order.
  \item Sometimes, the build system used by libraries or applications
    is not very cross-compile friendly, so some adaptations are
    necessary.
  \item There is no infrastructure to reproduce the build from
    scratch, which might cause problems if one component needs to be
    changed, if somebody else takes over the project, etc.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{System building: manually (2)}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Manual system building is not recommended for production
    projects
  \item However, using automated tools often requires the developer to
    dig into specific issues
  \item Having a basic understanding of how a system can be built
    manually is therefore very useful to fix issues encountered with
    automated tools
    \begin{itemize}
    \item We will first study manual system building, and during a
      practical lab, create a system using this method
    \item Then, we will study the automated tools available, and use
      one of them during a lab
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{System foundations}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item A basic root file system needs at least
    \begin{itemize}
    \item A traditional directory hierarchy, with \code{/bin},
      \code{/etc}, \code{/lib}, \code{/root}, \code{/usr/bin},
      \code{/usr/lib}, \code{/usr/share}, \code{/usr/sbin},
      \code{/var}, \code{/sbin}
    \item A set of basic utilities, providing at least the \code{init}
      program, a shell and other traditional UNIX command line
      tools. This is usually provided by {\em Busybox}
    \item The C library and the related libraries (thread, math, etc.)
      installed in \code{/lib}
    \item A few configuration files, such as \code{/etc/inittab}, and
      initialization scripts in \code{/etc/init.d}
    \end{itemize}
  \item On top of this foundation common to most embedded Linux
    systems, we can add third-party or in-house components
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Target and build spaces}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item The system foundation, Busybox and C library, are the core of
    the target root filesystem
  \item However, when building other components, one must distinguish
    two directories
    \begin{itemize}
    \item The {\em target} space, which contains the target root
      filesystem, everything that is needed for {\bf execution} of the
      application
    \item The {\em build} space, which will contain a lot more files
      than the {\em target} space, since it is used to keep everything
      needed to {\bf compile} libraries and applications. So we must
      keep the headers, documentation, and other configuration files
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{slides/sysdev-embedded-linux/source-build-target-spaces.pdf}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Build systems}
  Each open-source component comes with a mechanism to
  configure, compile and install it
  \begin{itemize}
  \item A basic \code{Makefile}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Need to read the \code{Makefile} to understand how it
      works and how to tweak it for cross-compilation
    \end{itemize}
  \item A build system based on the {\em Autotools}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item As this is the most common build system, we will study it
      in details
    \end{itemize}
  \item CMake, \url{https://cmake.org/}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Newer and simpler than the {\em autotools}. Used by
    (sometimes large) projects such as KDE, KiCad, LLVM / Clang,
    Scribus, OpenCV. Used by Netflix too.
    \end{itemize}
  \item Scons, \url{https://www.scons.org/}
  \item Waf, \url{https://github.com/waf-project/waf}
  \item Other manual build systems
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Autotools and friends}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item A family of tools, which associated together form a complete
    and extensible build system
    \begin{itemize}
    \item {\bf autoconf} is used to handle the configuration of the
      software package
    \item {\bf automake} is used to generate the Makefiles needed to
      build the software package
    \item {\bf pkgconfig} is used to ease compilation against already
      installed shared libraries
    \item {\bf libtool} is used to handle the generation of shared
      libraries in a system-independent way
    \end{itemize}
  \item Most of these tools are old and relatively complicated to use,
    but they are used by a majority of free software packages
    today. One must have a basic understanding of what they do and how
    they work.
  \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{automake / autoconf}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Files written by the developer
    \begin{itemize}
    \item \code{configure.in} describes the configuration options and
      the checks done at configure time
    \item \code{Makefile.am} describes how the software should be
      built
    \end{itemize}
  \item The \code{configure} script and the \code{Makefile.in} files
    are generated by \code{autoconf} and \code{automake} respectively.
    \begin{itemize}
    \item They should never be modified directly
    \item They are usually shipped pre-generated in the software
      package, because there are several versions of \code{autoconf}
      and \code{automake}, and they are not completely compatible
    \end{itemize}
  \item The \code{Makefile} files are generated at configure time, before
    compiling
    \begin{itemize}
    \item They are never shipped in the software package.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Configuring and compiling: native case}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item The traditional steps to configure and compile an autotools
    based package are
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Configuration of the package\\
      \code{./configure}
    \item Compilation of the package\\
      \code{make}
    \item Installation of the package\\
      \code{make install}
    \end{itemize}
  \item Additional arguments can be passed to the \code{./configure}
    script to adjust the component configuration
    (run \code{./configure --help})
  \item Only the \code{make install} target needs to be done as root if the
    installation should take place system-wide
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Configuring and compiling: cross case (1)}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item For cross-compilation, things are a little bit more complicated.
  \item At least some of the environment variables \code{AR},
    \code{AS}, \code{LD}, \code{NM}, \code{CC}, \code{GCC},
    \code{CPP}, \code{CXX}, \code{STRIP}, \code{OBJCOPY} must be
    defined to point to the proper cross-compilation tools. The host
    tuple is also by default used as prefix.
  \item \code{configure} script arguments:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item \code{--host}: mandatory but a bit confusing.
     Corresponds to the {\em target} platform the code will run on.
     Example: \code{--host=arm-linux}
    \item \code{--build}: build system. Automatically detected.
    \item \code{--target} is only for tools generating code.
    \end{itemize}
  \item It is also recommended to pass the \code{--prefix} argument. It
    defines from which location the software will run in the target
    environment. We recommend \code{/usr} instead of the default
    setting (\code{/usr/local}).
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Configuring and compiling: cross case (2)}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item If one simply runs \code{make install}, the software will be
    installed in the directory passed as \code{--prefix}. For
    cross-compiling, one must pass the \code{DESTDIR} argument to
    specify where the software must be installed.
  \item Making the distinction between the prefix (as passed with
    \code{--prefix} at configure time) and the destination directory (as
    passed with \code{DESTDIR} at installation time) is very important.
  \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Installation (1)}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item The autotools based software packages provide both
    \code{install} and \code{install-strip} make targets, used to
    install the software, either stripped or unstripped.
  \item For applications, the software is usually installed in
    \code{<prefix>/bin}, with configuration files in
    \code{<prefix>/etc} and data in
    \code{<prefix>/share/<application>/}
  \item The case of libraries is a little more complicated:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item In \code{<prefix>/lib}, the library itself (a
      \code{.so.<version>}), a few symbolic links, and
      the libtool description file (a \code{.la} file)
    \item The {\em pkgconfig} description file in
      \code{<prefix>/lib/pkgconfig}
    \item Include files in \code{<prefix>/include/}
    \item Sometimes a \code{<libname>-config} program in
      \code{<prefix>/bin} (older alternative to {\em pkgconfig})
    \item Documentation in \code{<prefix>/share/man} or
      \code{<prefix>/share/doc/}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Installation in the build and target spaces}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item From all these files, everything except documentation is
    necessary to build an application that relies on libpng.
    \begin{itemize}
    \item These files will go into the {\em build space}
    \end{itemize}
  \item However, only the library \code{.so} binaries in
    \code{<prefix>/lib} and some symbolic links are needed to execute
    the application on the target.
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Only these files will go in the {\em target space}
    \end{itemize}
  \item The build space must be kept in order to build other
    applications or recompile existing applications.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{pkg-config}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \code{pkg-config} is a tool that allows to query a small
    database to get information on how to compile programs that depend
    on libraries
  \item The database is made of \code{.pc} files, installed by default in
    \code{<prefix>/lib/pkgconfig/}.
  \item \code{pkg-config} is used by the \code{configure} script to get the
    library configurations
  \item It can also be used manually to compile an application:\\
    \code{arm-linux-gcc -o test test.c $(pkg-config --libs --cflags thelib)}
  \item By default, \code{pkg-config} looks in \code{/usr/lib/pkgconfig} for
    the \code{*.pc} files, and assumes that the paths in these files
    are correct.
  \item \code{PKG_CONFIG_LIBDIR} allows to set another location for the
    \code{*.pc} files and \code{PKG_CONFIG_SYSROOT_DIR} to prepend a
    prefix to the paths mentioned in the \code{.pc} files.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Let's find the libraries}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item When compiling an application or a library that relies on
    other libraries, the build process by default looks in
    \code{/usr/lib} for libraries and \code{/usr/include} for headers.
  \item The first thing to do is to set the \code{CFLAGS} and
    \code{LDFLAGS} environment
    variables:\\
    \code{export CFLAGS=-I/my/build/space/usr/include/}\\
    \code{export LDFLAGS=-L/my/build/space/usr/lib}
  \item The libtool files (\code{.la} files) must be modified because they
    include the absolute paths of the libraries:\\
    \code{- libdir='/usr/lib'}\\
    \code{+ libdir='/my/build/space/usr/lib}'
  \item The \code{PKG_CONFIG_LIBDIR} environment variable must be set to
    the location of the .pc files and the
    \code{PKG_CONFIG_SYSROOT_DIR} variable must be set to the build
    space directory.

  \frametitle{System building tools: principle}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Different tools are available to automate the process of
    building a target system, including the kernel, and sometimes the
    toolchain.
  \item They automatically download, configure, compile and install
    all the components in the right order, sometimes after applying
    patches to fix cross-compiling issues.
  \item They already support a large number of packages, that should
    fit your main requirements, and are easily extensible.
  \item The build becomes reproducible, which allows to easily change
    the configuration of some components, upgrade them, fix bugs, etc.

  \frametitle{Buildroot: adding a new package (1)}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item A package allows to integrate a user application or library to
    Buildroot
  \item Each package has its own directory (such as
    \code{package/gqview}). This directory contains:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item A \code{Config.in} file (mandatory), describing the
      configuration options for the package. At least one is needed to
      enable the package. This file must be sourced from
      \code{package/Config.in}
    \item A \code{gqview.mk} file (mandatory), describing how the
      package is built.
    \item A \code{.hash} file (optional, but recommended), containing
      hashes for the files to download.
    \item Patches (optional). Each file of the form
      \code{*.patch} will be applied as a patch.

  \frametitle{Buildroot: adding a new package (2)}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item For a simple package with a single configuration option to
    enable/disable it, the \code{Config.in} file looks like:
\footnotesize
\begin{block}{}
\begin{verbatim}
config BR2_PACKAGE_GQVIEW
        bool "gqview"
        depends on BR2_PACKAGE_LIBGTK2
        help
          GQview is an image viewer for UNIX operating systems

          http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/gqview
\end{verbatim}
\end{block}
\normalsize
  \item It must be sourced from \code{package/Config.in}:
\small
\begin{block}{}
\begin{verbatim}
source "package/gqview/Config.in"
\end{verbatim}
\end{block}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Buildroot: adding new package (3)}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Create the \code{gqview.mk} file to describe the build steps
\scriptsize
\begin{block}{}
\begin{verbatim}
GQVIEW_VERSION = 2.1.5
GQVIEW_SOURCE = gqview-$(GQVIEW_VERSION).tar.gz
GQVIEW_SITE = http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/gqview
GQVIEW_DEPENDENCIES = host-pkgconf libgtk2
GQVIEW_CONF_ENV = LIBS="-lm"
GQVIEW_LICENSE = GPL-2.0
GQVIEW_LICENSE_FILES = COPYING

$(eval $(autotools-package))
\end{verbatim}
\end{block}
\normalsize
\item The package directory and the prefix of all variables must be
  identical to the suffix of the main configuration option
  \code{BR2_PACKAGE_GQVIEW}
\item The \code{autotools-package} infrastructure knows how to build
  autotools packages. A more generic \code{generic-package}
  infrastructure is available for packages not using the autotools
  as their build system.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{OpenEmbedded / Yocto Project}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item The most versatile and powerful embedded Linux build system
    \begin{itemize}
    \item A collection of recipes (\code{.bb} files)
    \item A tool that processes the recipes: \code{bitbake}
    \end{itemize}
  \item Integrates 2000+ application and libraries, is highly
    configurable, can generate binary packages to make the system
    customizable, supports multiple versions/variants of the same
    package, no need for full rebuild when the configuration is
    changed.
  \item Configuration takes place by editing various configuration
    files
  \item Good for larger embedded Linux systems, or people looking for
    more configurability and extensibility
  \item Drawbacks: very steep learning curve, very long first build.

    Debian GNU/Linux, \url{https://www.debian.org}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Provides the easiest environment for quickly building prototypes
          and developing applications. Countless runtime and
          development packages available.
    \item But probably too costly to maintain
          and unnecessarily big for production systems.
    \item Available on multiple architectures: ARM (\code{armel},
          \code{armhf}, \code{arm64}), MIPS, PowerPC, RiscV (in progress)...
    \item Software is compiled natively by default.
    \item Use the \code{debootstrap} command to build a root
          filesystem for your architecture, with a custom selection
	  of packages.
    \item ELBE (\code{https://elbe-rfs.org}) is a more advanced
          environment for generating custom root filesystems
	  based on Debian.

    \begin{itemize}
    \item {\bf Tizen}: \url{https://www.tizen.org/} \\
      Targeting smartphones, wearables (watches), smart TVs and
      In Vehicle Infotainment devices.\\
      Supported by big phone manufacturers (mostly Samsung) and operators \\
      HTML5 base application framework. \\
      Wikipedia: 21\% of the smart TVs market share in 2018 \\
      See \url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tizen}

      Google's distribution for phones, tablets, TVs, cars...\\
      Except the Linux kernel, very different user space
      than other Linux distributions. Mostly successful in its target
      markets though.
