  \frametitle{Electronic copies of these documents}
     \begin{itemize}
        \item Electronic copies of your particular version of the
              materials are available on:\\
              {\scriptsize \url{\sessionurl}} \\
        \item Open the corresponding documents and use them throughout
              the course to look for explanations given earlier by the
              instructor.
        \item You will need these electronic versions because
	      we neither print any index nor any table of contents
	      (quite high environmental cost for little added value)
        \item For future reference, see the first slide to see where
              document updates will be available.
    \end{itemize}
